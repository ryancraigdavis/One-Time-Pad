# One-Time-Pad
One Time Pad program that encrypts a message, sends it via sockets to a decryption server which then sends the decrypted message back.

Five small programs that encrypt and decrypt information using a one-time pad-like system. 

These programs combine multi-processing code with socket-based inter-process communication. The programs are accessible from the command line using standard Unix features.
